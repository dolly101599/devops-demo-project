**Note:** This project is a fork of `opentelemetry-demo`. Thanks to the team and contributors for opensourcing this wonderful demo project. Definitely one of the best on internet.

## Welcome to the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop Demo

This repository contains the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop, a microservice-based
distributed system intended to illustrate the implementation of OpenTelemetry in
a near real-world environment.

Our goals are threefold:

- Provide a realistic example of a distributed system that can be used to
  demonstrate OpenTelemetry instrumentation and observability.
- Build a base for vendors, tooling authors, and others to extend and
  demonstrate their OpenTelemetry integrations.
- Create a living example for OpenTelemetry contributors to use for testing new
  versions of the API, SDK, and other components or enhancements.

We've already made [huge
progress](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md),
and development is ongoing. We hope to represent the full feature set of
OpenTelemetry across its languages in the future.

If you'd like to help (**which we would love**), check out our [contributing
guidance](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you'd like to extend this demo or maintain a fork of it, read our
[fork guidance](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/forking/).

## Quick start

You can be up and running with the demo in a few minutes. Check out the docs for
your preferred deployment method:

- [Docker](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/docker_deployment/)
- [Kubernetes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/kubernetes_deployment/)

## Documentation

For detailed documentation, see [Demo Documentation][docs]. If you're curious
about a specific feature, the [docs landing page][docs] can point you in the
right direction.

## 🧠 My Learning Experience (Personal Addendum)

> 📌 This section is added by Dolly Sri Vemula as part of a personal learning project.  
> Original authors and content remain credited as per the Apache 2.0 license.

This repository is based on the [Ultimate DevOps Project](https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/ultimate-devops-project-demo) by Abhishek Veeramalla. All rights and credits go to the original author. This version has been cloned and customized for my learning and portfolio purposes.
As part of my journey to better understand cloud-native observability and DevOps tooling, I explored this OpenTelemetry demo project thoroughly.

## 📚 What I Learned

As someone aiming to build a strong foundation in DevOps and cloud infrastructure, I used this project to learn and practice the following:

- Provisioning cloud infrastructure using **Terraform** (Infrastructure as Code)
- Creating and configuring **Amazon EKS** clusters to run Kubernetes workloads
- Containerizing applications using **Docker**
- Deploying microservices to Kubernetes using **kubectl** and **Kubernetes manifests**
- Implementing a CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration and **Argo CD** for Continuous Deployment
- Managing **DNS routing** via AWS Route 53
- Setting up **monitoring and logging** with **AWS CloudWatch**
- Following best practices for **networking**, **IAM roles**, and **cloud security**

## 💻 How I Learned

- I carefully followed each section of the original project documentation and video explanations from Abhishek Veeramalla’s [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-devops-bootcamp/), taking detailed notes along the way.
- Every part of the project was **implemented hands-on in my local system**, including:
  - Terraform setup and execution
  - Docker image creation and pushing to ECR
  - Manual EKS cluster creation and Kubernetes deployment
  - Configuration of CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Argo CD
  - Testing and troubleshooting on my own machine

This hands-on approach helped me understand not just the “how” but also the “why” behind each step in a real-world DevOps pipeline.
